        <p>My Name is Celio Castro. I am new in coding and would like to become a coder in the fintech industry.</p>
        <p>This is one Quote that got me inspired to join a coding bootcamp.
         "Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it." - Patrick McKenzie</p>
        <p>I hace zero experience with coding before. However, I realized that the opportunities are endless. Coding will allow me to have the opportunity to explore my creativity, solve problems and develop useful solutions.</p>
